**PLEASE NOTE:**

This is only a issue tracker for issues related to the CakePHP Application Skeleton.
For CakePHP Framework issues please use this [issue tracker](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues).


The best way to propose a feature is to open an issue first and discuss your ideas there before implementing them.

Always follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines when submitting a pull request. In particular, make sure existing tests still pass, and add tests for all new behavior. When fixing a bug, you may want to add a test to verify the fix.
